# Awesome Browser Data Science Libraries [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list of awesome libraries for doing data science that can run in your
browser. That doesn't just mean Javascript: thanks to WebAssembly, many data
science libraries from other languages are now available in the browser.

If you want to contribute to this list (please do), file a pull request.

Also, a listed repository should be deprecated if:

* Repository's owner explicitly say that "this library is not maintained".
* Not committed for long time (2~3 years).
